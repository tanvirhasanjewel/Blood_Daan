# Blood_Daan

Blood_Daan is a website where you can easily find your blood in your location. The website works :

1. Register on the website for your blood group and your location.
2. Find your blood in your location.
3. You can get any problem resolved with customer care.

## Introduction

1. Install XAMPP or WAMPP.
2. Open XAMPP Control panel and start [Apache] and [MySQL].
3. Download the project from GitHub(https://github.com/tanvirhasanjewel/Blood_Daan.git)
4. Extract files in C:\xampp\htdocs.
5. Open link localhost/phpmyadmin
6. Click on new at side navbar.
7. Give a database name as (blood_dann) and hit on create button.
8. After creating the database name, click on import.
9. Browse the file in the directory.
10. After importing successfully.

## Methodology:

1. Requirement Analysis: The first step is to identify the requirements for the system. This involves conducting a thorough analysis of the blood donation process and understanding the needs of the blood banks, hospitals, and other stakeholders. This information is used to develop a detailed list of functional and non-functional requirements for the system.

2. Design: Based on the requirements analysis, the system is designed. This involves creating a system architecture, designing the database schema, and developing user interface wireframes. The design phase also includes identifying the technologies and tools that will be used to develop the system.

3. Development: The development process involves creating the necessary database tables, implementing the business logic, and developing the user interface. The system is developed in iterations, with each iteration adding new functionality and features.

4. Testing: Once the system is developed, it is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and is free of bugs and errors. The testing process includes unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. The system is also tested for performance, scalability, and security.

5. Deployment: After testing, the system is deployed to a production environment. This involves setting up the necessary hardware and software, configuring the system, and migrating data from the old system, if applicable. The system is then made available to the end-users.

6. Maintenance: Once the system is deployed, it requires ongoing maintenance and support. This involves monitoring the system for issues, performing routine maintenance tasks, and providing user support. The maintenance phase also includes making updates and enhancements to the system as needed to address changing requirements or improve performance.


##Future Work:

In the future, we will be able to link all the city's blood banks to form a chain system that will make blood available to those in need (patients). There are too many categories of blood based on the content it contain. In the future, we can add information about the blood and its content so that the patient can filter the blood type that he or she seeks.

We can also provide a login feature for hospitals to request blood and for blood banks to keep track of their donors. If they need blood for stock or if the blood supply is low, they can contact donors via email or SMS for donation. When a blood bank donor needs blood due to an accident or an emergency, he or she will receive a discount on the blood price; as a result, when the donor donates blood, credits will be allocated to him or her in their login account.

The proposed system is intended to assist the Blood Bank administrator in meeting the demand for blood by sending and/or serving blood requests as needed. The proposed system outlines a step-by-step procedure for bridging the gap between recipients, donors, and blood banks. This website will serve as a common ground for all three parties and will ensure that the Recipient's and/or Blood Bank's requests for blood are met.

## Conclusion

Every day, technology introduces innovations, reducing the time it takes to complete tasks. In an emergency, the proposed system can be used to reduce the time it takes to deliver needed blood to those in need. People interested in donating blood can use the website to find their nearest location and donate blood. It also allows them to communicate with nearby donors in the event of an emergency. The database is one of the most important parts of the system. The proposed system makes use of Google Maps, which allows users to quickly locate nearby blood donors.
